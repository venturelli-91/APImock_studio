# API Mocking Studio

API Mocking Studio is a frontend platform that lets developers simulate REST endpoints directly in the browser. It is built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS** and **Zustand** to deliver a fast, modular and accessible experience for managing mock APIs.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- Create, edit and delete mock endpoints with real-time preview.
- Configure HTTP method, status code, headers, delays and JSON payloads per endpoint.
- Organise endpoints into collections tailored for different projects or teams.
- Validate and visualise JSON payloads with instant feedback.
- Persist data locally and prepare for future backend integration with minimal changes required.
- Enjoy polished UX with floating labels, toast notifications, modals and microinteractions.

## üß± Architecture Overview

The project follows SRP, DRY, KISS and Clean Architecture principles to keep the codebase scalable and easy to maintain.

```

### Shared UI primitives

- **Button** ‚Äì single-responsibility button with Tailwind utilities and theme variants.
- **Input / FloatingLabelInput / FloatingLabelTextarea** ‚Äì form controls with floating-label UX.

### Feature example: Endpoint Management

- `EndpointForm` encapsulates the fields required to configure mock endpoints (name, path, method, status code, description, headers, delay and payload).
- Components are composed from `shared` primitives to keep the business layer small and testable.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14** for server components, routing and build tooling.
- **TypeScript** for static typing and maintainability.
- **TailwindCSS** for utility-first styling and dark-mode support.
- **Zustand** for predictable, lightweight global state.

## üöÄ Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Run linting
pnpm lint
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The project currently focuses on the frontend. Backend integration endpoints can be wired in with minimal refactors thanks to the layered architecture.
